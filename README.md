# RfgTools++
C++ variant of this repo: https://github.com/Moneyl/Rfg-Tools. Won't necessarily convert all the tools there to c++. Want to compare working with binary formats using c++ vs c#. Also makes it easier to work with libraries like zlib when existing c# zlib wrappers/libs aren't working for my purposes.
